GPT-4 is the latest language model developed by OpenAI, one of the leading organizations in the field of artificial intelligence.GPT-4 is supposed to be bigger, faster, and more accurate than ChatGPT. OpenAI says that GPT-4 is more creative and collaborative than ever before.

## Performance Improvement

GPT-4 is expected to deliver a significant improvement in performance compared to its older version, GPT-3.5. While Chat GPT 3.5 was already one of the best AI models in the world, GPT -4 arrived to be even more advanced, with increased speed and capacity for handling multiple tasks at a time. It also improved "steerability," which allows users to command GPT-4 to write something in a different style, tone, or voice.

### GPT -4 Benchmark

OpenAI evaluated GPT-4 by simulating exams designed for humans, such as the Uniform Bar Examination and LSAT for lawyers, and the SAT for university admission. The results showed that GPT-4 achieved human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks.

OpenAI tested GPT-4 on conventional benchmarks that are commonly used for assessing machine learning models. The results showed that GPT-4 performed better than current large language models, as well as many advanced models that might have been specifically designed for the benchmark or trained using additional methods.

### Features came along with the new GPT -4

* GPT -4 can understand more complex inputs
    
* Multimodel capabilities
    
* Greater steerability
    
* Safety
    

### GPT -4 can process images along with the text.

The GPT -4 is multimodal, meaning it can parse both images and text, whereas the GPT-3.5 could only process text. This means GPT-4 can analyze the contents of an image and connect that information with a written question.

And OpenAI is also working with the startup Be **My Eyes**, which uses object recognition and human volunteers to help people with vision problems, to improve the company’s app with **GPT-4**.

### 2 incredible things GPT -4 can do

* **It can build a simple website:** “Generative AI,” which can build words or images based on a user’s prompt, has been all the rage in Silicon Valley for months. GPT-4 introduces “website-building” into the mix. Give the bot a few text prompts, and it can create a rudimentary site.
    
* **It can ace most standardized tests:** The previous version of ChatGPT was capable of achieving a passing score or getting close to it on the United States Medical Licensing Exam. It could also perform satisfactorily on final exams in law school and write a decent essay, but it was unable to pass the bar exam. This is considered weak or inadequate.
    

### 2 things to avoid asking from GPT -4

* **Medical Diagnosis:** GPT -4 is good at a lot of things, but providing accurate medical diagnoses isn't one of them. The GPT -4 will simply summarize the info it has pulled from the internet that might or might not be true. More importantly, it doesn't know your medical history or tolerance to certain substances and hence can't judge what kind of treatment would be right for you.
    
* **Legal Advice:** You might have headlines that ChatGPT successfully cleared US law school exams, and that AI chatbots are on their way to enter our courtrooms in the coming years. Some companies have already created specialized AI legal assistants, even marketing them as an affordable alternative to human lawyers. The obvious difference is that AI chatbots lack common sense. Things that are instinctively obvious to us humans need to be programmed into chatbots, which makes them less capable of logical reasoning.
    

### Gpt -4 is powering the new BING

Microsoft announced the new Bing-powered by ChatGPT earlier this year. The revamped search engine and several of its AI tools use OpenAI's technology to respond to questions and generate content. Now, it's **confirmed by Microsoft that the new Bing is powered by GPT-4.**

### How to gain access to the new GPT -4?

OpenAI is releasing GPT-4’s text input capability via ChatGPT. It is currently available to **ChatGPT Plus** users. There is a waitlist for the GPT-4 API.

The public availability of the image input capability has not yet been announced.
